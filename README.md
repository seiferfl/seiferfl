### 👋 Hi, I'm Florentin

I'm fascinated by the interface between **neuroscience** and **artificial intelligence** — especially when it comes to understanding **how biological systems learn, remember, and reason**.

🔬 **Current Interests**  
- Biological learning algorithms (and how they might differ from backpropagation)
- Working memory and sequence modeling
- Mechanistic interpretability of neural networks
- Science of Learning


🚧 **Current Projects**  
- 🤝 Collaborating with [@LeonardVetter](https://github.com/LeonardVetter) on a project implementing and dissecting toy models using mechanistic interpretability tools.
- 🧠 Building a repository of simple, biologically inspired models that can solve basic reasoning tasks — bridging intuition from neuroscience and ML.


🌱 **Currently Learning**

### 📘 Recent Questions I’ve Been Thinking About

> 🧩 What kind of internal representations enable flexible generalization in both brains and machines?  
> 🔁 Can simple recurrent structures (like RNNs) model working memory as efficiently as cortical circuits - and how?
