### 👋 Hi, I'm Florentin

I'm a Master's student in Neurophysics at Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen, currently doing a research internship with Christian Machens at Champalimaud Research in Lisbon.

🔬 **Current Interests**  
- Biological learning algorithms (and how they might differ from backpropagation)
- Working memory and sequence modeling
- Representation of information in neural networks
- Science of Learning


🚧 **Current Projects**  
- Devising a local learning rule for spiking RNNS 
- 🤝 Collaborating with [@LeonardVetter](https://github.com/LeonardVetter) on using statistical physics to better understand macroscopic dynamics in neural networks.


🌱 **Currently Learning**
- hopefully a lot.
